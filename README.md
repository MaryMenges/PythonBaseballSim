# PythonBaseballSim (B.A.S.E.S.)
#### Installation and Usage

BASES is a python application with a website front-end interface. The website was developed with the python web framework Bottle.

Run Website:

* First open up app.py and locate at the end of the file, the port number and debug option
* For production, turn debug to false (debug = false)
* The port number is anything to specify (i.e. 8888)
* Run the website by typing the command below into the command prompt

        python app.py

* Navigate to your webbrowser and enter [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/)

# About the Project

The BASES project was developed by a group of summer research students and professors at Monmouth University during the university's annual School of Science Summer Research Program.

This program intends to accurately simulate a baseball game from first pitch to last. The simulation will be based on real data obtained from the 2014 MLB season. The simulation will model a game pitch-by-pitch and use batting and pitching statistics as well as fielding statistics to best predict the outcome of a game.

Major Features/Goals:

*   Store relevant statistics of a single Major League Baseball Season in comma-separated values (CSV) files
*   Simulate the interaction between a batter and a pitcher
*   Simulate the actions of players on the field
*   Simulate the interaction between the home and away teams
*   Analyze the outcome of a simulated game based on the data provided
*   Allow the user to choose any two Major League Baseball teams to simulate a game
*   Provide a user interface with a scoreboard which updates throughout the game
